    <h1> #FreeThemNY </h1>

    <h2 id="call"> We call on Governor Cuomo to immediately use his clemency powers to free criminalized survivors of gender violence held in prisons in New York. </h2>

    <p> End the criminalization of survivors of domestic and sexual violence! </p>

    <h2 id="background"> Background </h2>
    <p> Throughout his time in office, Governor Cuomo has granted pardons to just 163 people, and commuted the sentences of only a dozen people. </p>
    <img src="images/clemency-and-pardons.png" alt="A graph displaying the numbers of petitions for clemency received versus commutations granted from 2011-2017. There are over a hundred applications in each year from 2011-2015. Zero commutations were issued from 2011-2014. In 2015 and 2016, a very small number were granted.  Data for clemency applications was not available in 2016 and 2017.">
    <p> These numbers are pitifully low compared to the more than 50,000 people held in prisons across New York State. </p>
    <p> The New York State Constitution grants the governor power to pardon or commute any sentence, at any time, for any reason. Our campaign calls on Governor Cuomo to use the powers of his office to immediately free criminalized survivors of gender violence! </p>
