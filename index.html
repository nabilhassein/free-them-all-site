    <h3> Participate in the call-in campaign to Cuomo's office on Wednesday November 14th </h3>


    <p>
      <strong>What is our call to action? </strong>

      <p>We’re asking Governor Cuomo and his administration to use his unlimited power to grant clemency and grant commutations to criminalized survivors of Domestic Violence currently incarcerated throughout the New York State Prison System.</p>

    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>What is a phone zap? </strong>

      <p>Call-in campaigns, also known as “phone zaps,” are one of many tools to directly let public officials and others know what you want them to do or to stop doing. </p>

    </p>

    <p> <strong> Who are we targeting? </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Office of Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo -- 518-474-8343 or 212-681-7753 </li>
        <li>Counsel to the Governor, Alphonso B David -- 212-681-7753 </li>
        <li>Executive Clemency Bureau -- (518) 457-7565 </li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="background"> Background </h2>
    <p> Throughout his time in office, Governor Cuomo has granted pardons to just 163 people, and commuted the sentences of only a dozen people. </p>
    <div class="dual-images">
      <img src="images/clemency.png" alt="A graph displaying the numbers of petitions for clemency received versus commutations granted from 2011-2017. There are over a hundred applications in each year from 2011-2015. Zero commutations were issued from 2011-2014. In 2015 and 2016, a very small number were granted.  Data for clemency applications was not available in 2016 and 2017.">
      <img src="images/pardons.png" alt="A graph displaying the numbers of petitions for pardon received versus pardons granted from 2011-2017. There are nearly 500 in 2011 with none granted, and over 100 in 2012 with none granted. From 2013-2015 there are between 50 and 100 petitions with very small numbers granted. 50-100 pardons were granted in each of 2016 and 2017. Data on petitions received in 2016 and 2017 was not available.">
    </div>
    <p> These numbers are pitifully low compared to the more than 50,000 people held in prisons across New York State. </p>
    <p> The New York State Constitution grants the governor power to pardon or commute any sentence, at any time, for any reason. Our campaign calls on Governor Cuomo to use the powers of his office to immediately free criminalized survivors of gender violence! </p>
