    <h2 id="call"> We call on Governor Cuomo to immediately use his clemency powers to free criminalized survivors of gender violence held in prisons in New York. </h2>

    <p> End the criminalization of survivors of domestic and sexual violence! </p>

    <h2> <a href="stories.html"> Read survivors' stories! </a></h2>

    <h2 id="background"> Background </h2>
    <p> Throughout his time in office, Governor Cuomo has granted pardons to just 163 people, and commuted the sentences of only a dozen people. </p>
    <img src="images/clemency-and-pardons.png" alt="A graph displaying the numbers of petitions for clemency received versus commutations granted from 2011-2017. There are over a hundred applications in each year from 2011-2015. Zero commutations were issued from 2011-2014. In 2015 and 2016, a very small number were granted.  Data for clemency applications was not available in 2016 and 2017.">
    <p> These numbers are pitifully low compared to the more than 50,000 people held in prisons across New York State. </p>
    <p> The New York State Constitution grants the governor power to pardon or commute any sentence, at any time, for any reason. Our campaign calls on Governor Cuomo to use the powers of his office to immediately free criminalized survivors of gender violence! </p>

    <h2> <a href="endorsements.html"> See the list of endorsing organizations! </a> </h2>

    <p> In stark contrast to Cuomo, gubernatorial candidate <a href="https://twitter.com/CynthiaNixon/status/1022946433140502528">Cynthia Nixon has stated</a> that she would use her powers to "commute the sentences of survivors of domestic violence who are incarcerated for acts of self-defense." </p>
    <img src="images/cynthia-nixon-endorsement.png" alt="a screenshot of a tweet by Cynthia Nixon with the text: Governor Cuomo has granted only 12 commutations since 2011. Meanwhile, Governor Brown of California issued 12 commutations on a single day. I will commute the sentences of survivors of domestic violence who are incarcerated for acts of self-defense.">

    <img src="images/postcards.jpg" alt="A picture of a large amount of survived and punished postcards in support of our campaign. Each postcard has art on the front including a person holding a sign saying: mamas don't belong in cages. One postcard is turned over to its back, with writing on it addressed to Governor Cuomo urging him to free survivors.">
