    <h1> Take Action! </h1>
    <h2> Here are some ways you can support the campaign: </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong> Support the #FreeThemNY PostcardPalooza Campaign! </strong>
        <p>
        We want New Yorkers to mail 10,000 postcards to Governor Andrew Cuomo. Can you help us reach our goal? There are many ways to support the postcard campaign!
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you are a New York resident, you can download the postcard templates <a href="files/postcard1.pdf">here</a> or <a href="files/postcard2.pdf">here</a>, and then print and mail it to Cuomo any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Come to our <a href="index.html#events"> upcoming events</a>, where we will have postcards you can fill out in person. We will mail the postcards for you.
          </li>
          <li> If you want us to mail you a stack of postcards that you promise to have people in your community fill out and then mail directly to the Governor, <a href="mailto:survivepunishnyc@gmail.com">email</a> your mailing address to us at survivepunishnyc@gmail.com and we'll mail you some cards.
          </li>
          <li>
            We're a volunteer-led effort funded through grassroots donations so if you have the means to make your own postcards, we have a pair of templates, <a href="files/postcard1.pdf">here</a> and <a href="files/postcard2.pdf">here</a>, that you can print out and get people in your community to mail to Cuomo. You can then mail the cards yourself.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want to donate to us to help us cover the postcard printing costs, you can do so <a href="http://www.survivedandpunished.org/donate.html">here</a>. (Select Survived and Punished NY so they allocate the funds properly.)

        <p> <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/content/governor-contact-form" target="_blank"> Contact the governor </a> </p>
        <p> Please call Governor Cuomo directly at 1-518-474-8390 if you can! You can also use the form linked above. Here is some suggested language you can use to begin the conversation or leave a message: </p>
        <p> I am disappointed in Governor Cuomo's decision to exercise his clemency powers so rarely. New York should be a leader in addressing the crisis of incarceration. I stand with the #FreeThemNY campaign to demand Governor Cuomo immediately use his clemency powers to free criminalized survivors of gender violence held in prisons in New York.</p>
