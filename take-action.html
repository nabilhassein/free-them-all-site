    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>What is a phone zap? </strong>

      <p>Call-in campaigns, also known as “phone zaps,” are one of many tools to directly let public officials and others know what you want them to do or to stop doing. </p>

    </p>

    <p> <strong> Who are we targeting? </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Office of Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo -- 518-474-8343 or 212-681-7753 </li>

      <strong> Sample Script: </strong>
      <br>
<p>Hi, I’m a New York State resident from _____ and I’m calling to urge Governor Cuomo to commute the sentences of criminalized survivors of gender violence who are incarcerated for acts of survival. Governor Cuomo did not grant clemency to any criminalized survivors of gender violence in 2018. Conservative Governor Bill Haslam of Tennessee has granted clemency to Cyntoia Brown- who is being released from prison this week – but Democratic Governor Cuomo who claims to be progressive failed to grant clemency to criminalized survivors. </p>

<p>In the eight and a half years Governor Cuomo has been in office, he’s only commuted the sentences of 18 people. Only one of those 18 commutations has been for a survivor of domestic violence. I’m calling to urge Governor Cuomo to use his clemency powers and commute the sentences of survivors of domestic violence who are imprisoned for survival actions, including defending their lives or the lives of their children, removing children from abusive people, and acting as an “accomplice” under coercion. Are you the person I can speak to about this? This will take 5 minutes of your time. </p>

<p>[No, but I will connect you to the right extension]: Thank you. (when connected, repeat above). </p>

<p>[No]: Can you please connect me to the right extension? Can you provide me the correct number in case we get disconnected?</p>

<p>[Yes.]: Great, what’s your name? [PAUSE TO HEAR NAME] Great, NAME, thanks for your time. In eight and a half years, Governor Cuomo has only pardoned 185 people after they’ve served their sentences, and he has commuted the sentences of only 18. Right now, there are people in NY State prisons who are incarcerated because they had to defend themselves against their abusers for their own life. Many of them were given plea deals and their case was never even heard at trial. Governor Cuomo should free them all, but I have a list of currently incarcerated people he can free right now. The group I am calling on behalf of, Survived & Punished NY, has spoken to and is specifically urging Governor Cuomo to free:</p>

    <p> I am disappointed in Governor Cuomo's decision to exercise his clemency powers so rarely. New York should be a leader in addressing the crisis of incarceration. I stand with the #FreeThemNY campaign to demand Governor Cuomo immediately use his clemency powers to free criminalized survivors of gender violence held in prisons in New York.</p>
